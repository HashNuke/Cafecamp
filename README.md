# Cafecamp (early 2008)

This repo contains the source code of a social network I developed (and was operated for a while) in early 2008.

Don't expect MVC. Don't expect clean code. Don't expect any programming abstractions or concepts here. __The only thing it does is: work__.

If you want to get it working. grep the codebase for "some_password" and replace it with the password of the database. And along with it the database name, user and host. Some parts of the site might require the Flickr API. For that grep the codebase for "FLICKR_API" and replace it with Flickr API key and secret.
